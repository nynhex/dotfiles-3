# dotfiles

This is not really much. It's a bunch of zsh and perhaps other shells init files.
That's about it. Boring huh...?

So, this includes
 * homebrew
 * zsh
 * antigen
 * vundle
 * iTerm2
 * Hyper.is
 * Prezto
 * Powerline9k
 * bash
 * vim

I'll add in my emacs configs at some point when I get around to it.

/S
